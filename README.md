# Viceroy Cybersecurity Resources

Welcome!  
This repository contains the resources I created and used during my time as a **Viceroy Cybersecurity Scholar & Intern** at Texas A&M University–San Antonio (2025). It serves as both an archive and a showcase of the materials that supported workshops, training sessions, and community engagement in cybersecurity.
